# wear_AI

Wear_AI is an AI software that can help you decide what to wear. 
It's still under development, and it is an artificial intelligence project that aims to produce a mobile application as a product.
The following is the potential steps to achieve:


1. Recognizing the types and color of clothing

There are many types of clothing, while some types and color of clothing certainly do not match. 
Also, identifying the types and color of clothing should be the first step to achieve as it seems to be easier. 

1.5 Recognizing the types and color of clothing in a human picture

Analyzing the clothing on a plain area and analyzing the outfit on a human being is different. The difficulties should be much harder.
   
   
2. Finding a piece of match clothing when supplied with another one

This is when the application starts to be able to use, and is one of the major function of this application.
When user upload a piece of top that they have, the AI should be able to choose a matching bottom, vice versa. 
The selection criteria should be according to data that collect from people and maybe online, by ratings to others clothing.
Types and color should be two of the major concerns of AI when analyzing the correlation between set of clothing and the ratings.


3. Find a set of clothing to user according to his/her upload

This is one of the major function of this application.
User should upload some of their clothes (at least 10 - 20), and the AI will help him/her to match them. 
AI may suggest the set of outfit for today according to the weather, user's mood and the venue that the user is attending.


4. An AI robot that can wear the clothing on themselves

This should be the last and final step of the application.
User can design an AI robot according to their body shape and gender. 
Then, the AI can apply the clothing on the robot, simulating the look when the user is wearing it. 
As it includes 3D modeling and many other technologies, this is the last step for improvement.
